Just helping to create a new repo and studying tooo....

Left most side of your homepage there you can see repositories and 'NEW' button. Click on the new button .
Then you have to give a name and some description (not necessary) to your new repository
You can also make your repository public or private.
Then click "create repository".
Now you can see some command need for you to create repository, commit , push, etc. in command line.
Now we are doing this without command line.
Click on 'Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file'. 
For creating a new file or to upload,
click 'creating a new file'.
Then you can see edit new file window, where you can write your code.
Now just write something....
Happy Coding!!!
